          Hello! I'm Devin, a professional with nearly 11 years of experience in
          the music instrument retail industry, where I've worked as both a
          retail associate and manager. During the challenging times of the 2020
          pandemic, I found myself furloughed for six months. It was during this
          hiatus that I made a life-changing decision to teach myself how to
          code. In early 2021, I embarked on a transformative journey by
          enrolling in a six-month full-time web development program at the
          Nashville Software School. My dedication paid off as I secured my
          first web development job just one week before graduating, making me
          the first person in my cohort to land a job. Now, as a web developer,
          I'm blending my passion for technology with the skills and work ethic
          honed during my time in the music industry, creating beautiful digital
          experiences and solutions that resonate with users and clients alike.
          Welcome to my digital stage!
